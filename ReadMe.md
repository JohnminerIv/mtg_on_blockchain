Not all features have been tested becuse testing in remixe's solidity testing is hard and I suck at it.

Some features are missing. You can't see the type of land that was created and you can't see how much of what mana you have.
Some other getter functions are missing as well.

Brownie will not compile this code don't try. I need to change the file structure and find a better testing environment maybe truffle.

I like this project and plan to work on it in the future, If you like it too reach out if you want to work on it.
