# MTG on the blockchain
## This project is in no way affiliated with the actual magic the gathering
## it is an entirly different game but uses similar gameplay mechanics and
## vernacular.

This project is a blockchain "port" of the popular game Magic the Gathering.\
And by "port" I mean that its what I imagined MTG might look like if it was\
built on the blockchain.

There is not a user interface built, though hopefully I'll get around to that\
sometime in the future.

For now, if you want to test out the application thats deployed to an\
ethereum testnet you can use these auto-generated interfaces here:

https://oneclickdapp.com/window-memo/ 

Not all features have been tested becuse testing in remixe's solidity testing\
is hard and I'm pretty bad at it.

Some features are missing. You can't see the type of land that was created\
and you can't see how much of what mana you have. Some other getter\
functions are missing as well.

Brownie will not compile this code don't try. I need to change the file\
structure and find a better testing environment (maybe truffle will work).

I like this project and plan to work on it in the future, If you like it\
too reach out if you want to work on it.
