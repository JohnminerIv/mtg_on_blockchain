The main token will be a plainswalker.

Each wallet can have one active plainswalker at a time.

If the plainswalker is active it can harvest mana from owned lands.
This can be done every 6 hours.

If the plainswalker is active it can summon randomly generated creatures
using owned mana, the strength is based on the mana used.

Each creature can either be in attack or defence. A creature in defence is 
unable to attack until it is switched to attack mode. A creature can attack
once every 6 hours. If it has attacked it cannot switch to deffence mode 
until the 6 hours are up.

While the plainswalker is active it can earn plainar coin that can be
used to buy permanent or temporary spell cards. This can be harvested
every 6 hours.

If the plainswalker is killed all mana is lost, as well as all creatures.
Spell cards and plainar coin is retained. The next harvest of plainar coin 
is sent to the killer instead.
